1. what are the difference between dynamic and static binding?
==============================================================
Dynamic binding and static binding are two different approaches to method resolution in object-oriented programming. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **Dynamic Binding**: Also known as late binding, it refers to the process of resolving method calls at runtime. The method to be executed is determined based on the actual object type rather than the reference type.
   - **Static Binding**: Also known as early binding, it refers to the process of resolving method calls at compile time. The method to be executed is determined based on the reference type.
2. **When it occurs**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Occurs during runtime when the actual object type is known. It is commonly used in polymorphism, where a base class reference can point to derived class objects.
    - **Static Binding**: Occurs during compile time when the method to be executed is determined based on the reference type. It is typically used for private, static, and final methods.
3. **Performance**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Generally slower than static binding because it requires additional overhead to determine the method to be executed at runtime.
    - **Static Binding**: Generally faster than dynamic binding because the method to be executed is determined at compile time, leading to more optimized code.
4. **Use Cases**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Used in scenarios where polymorphism is required, such as when a base class reference is used to call methods of derived classes.
    - **Static Binding**: Used in scenarios where the method to be executed is known at compile time, such as when calling private, static, or final methods.
5. **Example**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: In Java, when you override a method in a subclass and call it using a base class reference, the actual method executed is determined at runtime based on the object type.
    - **Static Binding**: In Java, when you call a static method or a private method, the method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the reference type.
6. **Language Support**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Supported in most object-oriented programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and C#.
    - **Static Binding**: Also supported in most object-oriented programming languages, but the specific rules and behavior may vary between languages.
7. **Flexibility**:
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Provides more flexibility and extensibility, allowing for more dynamic behavior in the code.
    - **Static Binding**: Provides less flexibility but can lead to more efficient code execution due to compile-time resolution.
8. **Example in Java**:
    ```java
    class Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Dynamic binding
            myDog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
        }
    }
    ```
    ```java
    class Example {
        static void display() {
            System.out.println("Static method");
        }
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Example.display(); // Static binding
        }
    }
    ```
In summary, dynamic binding allows for more flexible and extensible code by resolving method calls at runtime based on the actual object type, while static binding resolves method calls at compile time based on the reference type, leading to potentially more efficient code execution.

2. what is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
=========================================================
Method overloading and method overriding are two important concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Java, C++, and C#. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Definition**:
   - **Method Overloading**: It is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists (different type, number, or both). It is a compile-time polymorphism.
   - **Method Overriding**: It is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is a runtime polymorphism.
2. **Purpose**:
    - **Method Overloading**: It is used to increase the readability of the code by allowing the same method name to perform different tasks based on the parameters passed.
    - **Method Overriding**: It is used to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass, allowing for dynamic method resolution.
3. **Parameters**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The methods must have different parameter lists (different type, number, or both) to be considered overloaded.
    - **Method Overriding**: The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass to be considered overridden.
4. **Return Type**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The return type can be the same or different for overloaded methods, but it is not considered for method overloading.
    - **Method Overriding**: The return type must be the same or a subtype (covariant return type) of the return type in the superclass method.
5. **Access Modifiers**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The access modifiers can be the same or different for overloaded methods.
    - **Method Overriding**: The access modifier of the overriding method must be the same or more accessible than the method in the superclass.
6. **Inheritance**:
    - **Method Overloading**: It does not require inheritance; it can occur within the same class.
    - **Method Overriding**: It requires inheritance; it occurs between a superclass and a subclass.
7. **Compile-time vs Runtime**:
    - **Method Overloading**: Resolved at compile time (static binding).
    - **Method Overriding**: Resolved at runtime (dynamic binding).
8. **Example**:
    ```java
    class MathOperations {
        // Method Overloading
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        double add(double a, double b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
    class Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        // Method Overriding
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
            System.out.println(math.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
            System.out.println(math.add(5.5, 10.5)); // Output: 16.0

            Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Dynamic binding
            myDog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
        }
    }
    ```
In summary, method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. Overloading is resolved at compile time, while overriding is resolved at runtime.


3. what is the difference between abstract class and interface?
=========================================================
Abstract classes and interfaces are both used to achieve abstraction in object-oriented programming, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

1. Definition:
   - **Abstract Class**: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with a body). It can provide a common base for derived classes.
   - **Interface**: An interface is a reference type in Java (and similar languages) that is used to specify a contract for classes. It can only contain method signatures (abstract methods) and constants (static final variables). Interfaces do not have any implementation.
2. Purpose:
    - **Abstract Class**: It is used to provide a common base for related classes and to define some default behavior that can be shared among derived classes.
    - **Interface**: It is used to define a contract that classes must adhere to, allowing for multiple inheritance of type and behavior.
3. Method Implementation:
    - **Abstract Class**: It can have both abstract methods (without a body) and concrete methods (with a body). Derived classes can inherit the concrete methods and override the abstract methods.
    - **Interface**: All methods in an interface are abstract by default (until Java 8, which introduced default and static methods). Classes that implement the interface must provide implementations for all the methods defined in the interface.
4. Multiple Inheritance:
    - **Abstract Class**: A class can inherit from only one abstract class (single inheritance).
    - **Interface**: A class can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance), allowing for more flexible design.
5. Access Modifiers:
    - **Abstract Class**: It can have access modifiers (public, protected, private) for its methods and variables.
    - **Interface**: All methods in an interface are implicitly public and abstract, and all variables are implicitly public, static, and final.
6. Constructor:

    - **Abstract Class**: It can have constructors, which can be used to initialize instance variables.
    - **Interface**: It cannot have constructors, as it cannot be instantiated.
7. Fields:
    - **Abstract Class**: It can have instance variables (fields) with any access modifier.
    - **Interface**: It can only have static final variables (constants) that are implicitly public, static, and final.
8. Example:
    ```java
    abstract class Animal {
        abstract void sound(); // Abstract method
        void eat() { // Concrete method
            System.out.println("Animal eats");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void sound() { // Implementing abstract method
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
    interface Vehicle {
        void start(); // Abstract method
        void stop(); // Abstract method
    }
    class Car implements Vehicle {
        public void start() { // Implementing interface method
            System.out.println("Car starts");
        }
        public void stop() { // Implementing interface method
            System.out.println("Car stops");
        }
    }
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Animal myDog = new Dog();
            myDog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
            myDog.eat(); // Output: Animal eats

            Vehicle myCar = new Car();
            myCar.start(); // Output: Car starts
            myCar.stop(); // Output: Car stops
        }
    }
    ```
In summary, abstract classes are used to provide a common base for related classes and can contain both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to and can only contain abstract methods (until Java 8). Abstract classes support single inheritance, while interfaces support multiple inheritance. Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables, while interfaces cannot.


4. what is the difference between final, finally and finalize?
=========================================================
In Java, `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` are three distinct concepts that serve different purposes. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **final**:
   - **Definition**: The `final` keyword is used to declare constants, methods, and classes that cannot be modified or overridden.
   - **Usage**:
     - When applied to a variable, it makes the variable a constant (its value cannot be changed).
     - When applied to a method, it prevents the method from being overridden in subclasses.
     - When applied to a class, it prevents the class from being subclassed.
   - **Example**:
     ```java
     final int MAX_VALUE = 100; // Constant
     final class FinalClass { // Cannot be subclassed
         final void display() { // Cannot be overridden
             System.out.println("Final method");
         }
     }
     ```
2. **finally**:
    - **Definition**: The `finally` block is used in exception handling to execute a block of code after a try-catch block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.
    - **Usage**: It is typically used to release resources, close connections, or perform cleanup operations that must occur regardless of whether an exception occurred.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      try {
            // Code that may throw an exception
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException
      } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
      } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed"); // This will always execute
      }
      ```
3. **finalize**:
    - **Definition**: The `finalize()` method is a protected method of the `Object` class that is called by the garbage collector before an object is removed from memory. It allows an object to perform cleanup operations before it is garbage collected.
    - **Usage**: It is used to release resources or perform cleanup tasks, but it is not recommended for general use due to unpredictability in when it will be called.
    - **Example**:
      ```java
      class MyClass {
            @Override
            protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
                 try {
                  // Cleanup code before garbage collection
                  System.out.println("Finalize method called");
                 } finally {
                  super.finalize();
                 }
            }
      }
      ```
In summary:
- `final` is used to declare constants, methods, and classes that cannot be modified or overridden.
- `finally` is used in exception handling to execute a block of code after a try-catch block, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- `finalize` is a method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is removed from memory, allowing for cleanup operations. However, its use is discouraged in favor of try-with-resources or explicit resource management.


5. what is the difference between throw and throws?
=========================================================
In Java, `throw` and `throws` are both related to exception handling, but they serve different purposes. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **throw**: The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or a block of code. It is followed by an instance of the exception class.
   - **throws**: The `throws` keyword is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method may throw one or more exceptions. It specifies the types of exceptions that can be thrown by the method.
2. **Usage**:
    - **throw**: It is used to throw an exception explicitly, either a checked or unchecked exception. It can be used anywhere in the code where an exception needs to be thrown.
    - **throws**: It is used in the method signature to declare that the method may throw certain exceptions. It is typically used for checked exceptions that are not handled within the method.
3. **Syntax**:
    - **throw**: The syntax for using `throw` is as follows:
      ```java
      throw new ExceptionType("Error message");
      ```
    - **throws**: The syntax for using `throws` in a method declaration is as follows:
      ```java
      public void methodName() throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 {
          // Method body
      }
      ```
4. **Example**:
```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
class Example {
    // Method that may throw an exception
    public void riskyMethod() throws CustomException {
        // Some code that may cause an exception
        boolean errorOccurred = true; // Simulating an error
        if (errorOccurred) {
            throw new CustomException("An error occurred in riskyMethod");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example example = new Example();
        try {
            example.riskyMethod(); // Calling the method that may throw an exception
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `riskyMethod()` declares that it may throw a `CustomException` using the `throws` keyword.
- Inside the `riskyMethod()`, the `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw a new instance of `CustomException` if an error occurs.
- In the `main()` method, the `riskyMethod()` is called within a try-catch block to handle the exception that may be thrown.
In summary:
- `throw` is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block of code, while `throws` is used in a method declaration to indicate that the method may throw certain exceptions.


6. what is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
=========================================================
Checked and unchecked exceptions are two categories of exceptions in Java, and they differ in how they are handled and declared. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **Checked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that are checked at compile time. The Java compiler requires that checked exceptions be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword.
   - **Unchecked Exceptions**: These are exceptions that are not checked at compile time. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException` and `Error`. The compiler does not require them to be caught or declared.
2. **Hierarchy**:
    - **Checked Exceptions**: They are part of the `Exception` class hierarchy but are not subclasses of `RuntimeException`. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, and `ClassNotFoundException`.
    - **Unchecked Exceptions**: They are part of the `RuntimeException` class hierarchy or the `Error` class hierarchy. Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and `ArithmeticException`.
3. **Handling**:
    - **Checked Exceptions**: They must be handled explicitly using try-catch blocks or declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword. This ensures that the programmer is aware of the potential exceptions that may occur.
    - **Unchecked Exceptions**: They do not need to be handled explicitly. The programmer can choose to handle them, but it is not mandatory. Unchecked exceptions usually indicate programming errors that should be fixed rather than caught.
4. **Use Cases**:
    - **Checked Exceptions**: They are typically used for conditions that a program should anticipate and recover from, such as file not found, network errors, or database access issues.
    - **Unchecked Exceptions**: They are typically used for programming errors that are not expected to be handled, such as null pointer dereferences, array index out of bounds, or arithmetic errors.
5. **Example**:
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;
class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public void readFile() throws FileNotFoundException {
        File file = new File("nonexistent.txt");
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file); // This may throw FileNotFoundException
    }
}
class UncheckedExceptionExample {
    public void divide(int a, int b) {
        int result = a / b; // This may throw ArithmeticException if b is 0
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CheckedExceptionExample checkedExample = new CheckedExceptionExample();
        try {
            checkedExample.readFile(); // Must handle or declare FileNotFoundException
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught checked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        UncheckedExceptionExample uncheckedExample = new UncheckedExceptionExample();
        try {
            uncheckedExample.divide(10, 0); // May throw ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught unchecked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `readFile()` method in the `CheckedExceptionExample` class declares that it may throw a `FileNotFoundException`, which is a checked exception. The caller must handle this exception.
- The `divide()` method in the `UncheckedExceptionExample` class may throw an `ArithmeticException`, which is an unchecked exception. The caller is not required to handle this exception, but it can choose to do so.
In summary:
- Checked exceptions are checked at compile time, must be handled or declared, and are used for conditions that can be anticipated and recovered from.
- Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time, do not need to be handled or declared, and are typically used for programming errors that should be fixed rather than caught.
7. what is the difference between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer?
=========================================================
`String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer` are all classes in Java used to handle strings, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **String**: It is an immutable class that represents a sequence of characters. Once a `String` object is created, its value cannot be changed.
   - **StringBuilder**: It is a mutable class that represents a sequence of characters. It allows for the modification of the string without creating new objects.
   - **StringBuffer**: It is also a mutable class similar to `StringBuilder`, but it is synchronized, making it thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can safely access a `StringBuffer` object without causing data inconsistency.
2. **Mutability**:
    - **String**: Immutable. Any modification to a `String` object creates a new object.
    - **StringBuilder**: Mutable. It allows modifications without creating new objects.
    - **StringBuffer**: Mutable. It allows modifications and is synchronized for thread safety.
3. **Performance**:
    - **String**: Slower for concatenation and modification operations because it creates new objects for each change.
    - **StringBuilder**: Faster than `String` for concatenation and modification operations because it modifies the existing object.
    - **StringBuffer**: Slower than `StringBuilder` due to synchronization overhead, but it is thread-safe.
4. **Thread Safety**:
    - **String**: Not applicable, as it is immutable.
    - **StringBuilder**: Not thread-safe. It is not synchronized, so it should not be used in a multi-threaded environment without external synchronization.
    - **StringBuffer**: Thread-safe. It is synchronized, making it suitable for use in multi-threaded environments.
5. **Use Cases**:
    - **String**: Used when the string value is not expected to change, such as in constant strings or when working with string literals.
    - **StringBuilder**: Used when frequent modifications to the string are required, such as in loops or when building strings dynamically.
    - **StringBuffer**: Used when thread safety is required while modifying strings in a multi-threaded environment.
6. **Example**:
```java
public class StringExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // String
        String str1 = "Hello";
        str1 += " World"; // Creates a new String object
        System.out.println("String: " + str1); // Output: Hello World

        // StringBuilder
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
        sb.append(" World"); // Modifies the existing StringBuilder object
        System.out.println("StringBuilder: " + sb.toString()); // Output: Hello World

        // StringBuffer
        StringBuffer sbuf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
        sbuf.append(" World"); // Modifies the existing StringBuffer object
        System.out.println("StringBuffer: " + sbuf.toString()); // Output: Hello World
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `String` object `str1` is modified using concatenation, which creates a new `String` object.
- The `StringBuilder` object `sb` is modified using the `append()` method, which modifies the existing object.
- The `StringBuffer` object `sbuf` is also modified using the `append()` method, which modifies the existing object and is thread-safe.
In summary:
- `String` is immutable and creates new objects for modifications, making it slower for concatenation.
- `StringBuilder` is mutable, faster for concatenation, and not thread-safe.
- `StringBuffer` is mutable, faster for concatenation, and thread-safe due to synchronization. Choose `StringBuilder` for single-threaded scenarios and `StringBuffer` for multi-threaded scenarios where thread safety is required.


8. what is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
=========================================================
Shallow copy and deep copy are two different ways of copying objects in programming, particularly in object-oriented languages like Java, C++, and Python. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object, but it copies only the references to the original object's fields. If the original object contains references to other objects, the shallow copy will reference the same objects rather than creating new copies of them.
   - **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects referenced by the original object. This means that all nested objects are also copied, resulting in a completely independent copy of the original object.
2. **Memory Allocation**:
    - **Shallow Copy**: The shallow copy shares the same memory location for the referenced objects. Changes made to the referenced objects in either the original or copied object will affect both.
    - **Deep Copy**: The deep copy allocates new memory for all objects, including nested objects. Changes made to the copied object do not affect the original object and vice versa.
3. **Performance**:
    - **Shallow Copy**: Generally faster than deep copy because it only copies references and does not require additional memory allocation for nested objects.
    - **Deep Copy**: Generally slower than shallow copy because it involves recursively copying all objects, which can be time-consuming and memory-intensive.
4. **Use Cases**:
    - **Shallow Copy**: Used when the original and copied objects are intended to share the same references to nested objects, and changes to those objects should be reflected in both.
    - **Deep Copy**: Used when a completely independent copy of the original object is required, and changes to the copied object should not affect the original object.
5. **Example**:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
class ShallowCopyExample {
    int[] arr;

    ShallowCopyExample(int[] arr) {
        this.arr = arr;
    }

    // Method to create a shallow copy
    ShallowCopyExample shallowCopy() {
        return new ShallowCopyExample(this.arr);
    }
}
class DeepCopyExample {
    int[] arr;

    DeepCopyExample(int[] arr) {
        this.arr = arr;
    }

    // Method to create a deep copy
    DeepCopyExample deepCopy() {
        return new DeepCopyExample(Arrays.copyOf(this.arr, this.arr.length));
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Shallow Copy
        int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3};
        ShallowCopyExample original = new ShallowCopyExample(originalArray);
        ShallowCopyExample shallowCopy = original.shallowCopy();
        shallowCopy.arr[0] = 10; // Modifying the shallow copy
        System.out.println("Original Array after shallow copy modification: " + Arrays.toString(original.arr)); // Output: [10, 2, 3]

        // Deep Copy
        int[] originalArray2 = {1, 2, 3};
        DeepCopyExample original2 = new DeepCopyExample(originalArray2);
        DeepCopyExample deepCopy = original2.deepCopy();
        deepCopy.arr[0] = 10; // Modifying the deep copy
        System.out.println("Original Array after deep copy modification: " + Arrays.toString(original2.arr)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `ShallowCopyExample` class creates a shallow copy of the array. Modifying the shallow copy affects the original array because they share the same reference.
- The `DeepCopyExample` class creates a deep copy of the array using `Arrays.copyOf()`. Modifying the deep copy does not affect the original array because they are independent copies.
In summary:
- Shallow copy creates a new object but shares references to nested objects, leading to shared state.
- Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects, resulting in independent copies.


9. what is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
=========================================================
Method overloading and method overriding are two important concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Java, C++, and C#. Here are the key differences between them:
1. **Definition**:
   - **Method Overloading**: It is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists (different type, number, or both). It is a compile-time polymorphism.
   - **Method Overriding**: It is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is a runtime polymorphism.
2. **Purpose**:
    - **Method Overloading**: It is used to increase the readability of the code by allowing the same method name to perform different tasks based on the parameters passed.
    - **Method Overriding**: It is used to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass, allowing for dynamic method resolution.
3. **Parameters**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The methods must have different parameter lists (different type, number, or both) to be considered overloaded.
    - **Method Overriding**: The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass to be considered overridden.
4. **Return Type**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The return type can be the same or different for overloaded methods, but it is not considered for method overloading.
    - **Method Overriding**: The return type must be the same or a subtype (covariant return type) of the return type in the superclass method.
5. **Access Modifiers**:
    - **Method Overloading**: The access modifiers can be the same or different for overloaded methods.
    - **Method Overriding**: The access modifier of the overriding method must be the same or more accessible than the method in the superclass.
6. **Inheritance**:
    - **Method Overloading**: It does not require inheritance; it can occur within the same class.
    - **Method Overriding**: It requires inheritance; it occurs between a superclass and a subclass.
7. **Compile-time vs Runtime**:
    - **Method Overloading**: Resolved at compile time (static binding).
    - **Method Overriding**: Resolved at runtime (dynamic binding).
8. **Example**:
```java
class MathOperations {
    // Method Overloading
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Method Overriding
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        System.out.println(math.add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
        System.out.println(math.add(5.5, 10.5)); // Output: 16.0

        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Dynamic binding
        myDog.sound(); // Output: Dog barks
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `MathOperations` class demonstrates method overloading with two `add` methods that have different parameter types.
- The `Animal` class and its subclass `Dog` demonstrate method overriding, where the `sound` method in the `Dog` class provides a specific implementation of the `sound` method defined in the `Animal` class.
In summary, method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, while method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. Overloading is resolved at compile time, while overriding is resolved at runtime.

10. create custom exception in java
=========================================================
```java
// Custom Exception Class
class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
// Class to demonstrate the use of custom exception
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        this.name = name;
        setAge(age);
    }

    public void setAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 0) {
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age cannot be negative: " + age);
        }
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
// Main class to test the custom exception
public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Person person = new Person("John Doe", -5); // This will throw InvalidAgeException
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught custom exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `InvalidAgeException` class is a custom exception that extends the `Exception` class. It takes a message as a parameter to provide more information about the exception.
- The `Person` class has a constructor and a method to set the age. If the age is negative, it throws an `InvalidAgeException`.
- The `CustomExceptionExample` class demonstrates how to use the custom exception by creating a `Person` object with an invalid age, which results in the exception being thrown and caught in the `main` method.
This example illustrates how to create and use a custom exception in Java, allowing for better error handling and more meaningful error messages in your applications.
11. create a custom annotation in java
=========================================================
```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;
// Custom Annotation
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) // Annotation is available at runtime
@Target(ElementType.METHOD) // Annotation can be applied to methods
@interface CustomAnnotation {
    String value() default "Default Value"; // Annotation element with a default value
}
// Class to demonstrate the use of custom annotation
class AnnotatedClass {
    @CustomAnnotation(value = "Custom Annotation Example")
    public void annotatedMethod() {
        System.out.println("This method is annotated with CustomAnnotation.");
    }
}
// Main class to test the custom annotation









11. what is idempotent? Explain with example.
=========================================================
Idempotence is a property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, particularly in the context of functions and APIs. An operation is considered idempotent if performing it multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. In other words, no matter how many times you apply the operation, the result remains the same after the first application.
Idempotence is an important concept in distributed systems, RESTful APIs, and database operations, as it allows for safe retries and ensures that repeated requests do not lead to unintended side effects.
In the context of HTTP methods, the following methods are considered idempotent:
- **GET**: Fetching a resource does not change its state. Multiple GET requests for the same resource will return the same result.

Is POST idempotent?

Is PUT idempotent?

Is DELETE idempotent?

is PATCH idempotent?
- **PUT**: Updating a resource with the same data multiple times will not change its state after the first update. For example, if you set a user's age to 30 using a PUT request, sending the same request again will not change the age.
- **DELETE**: Deleting a resource multiple times has the same effect as deleting it once. If you delete a resource and then try to delete it again, the second request will not change the state of the system.
- **PATCH**: The idempotence of PATCH depends on the operation being performed. If the PATCH request modifies a resource in a way that applying it multiple times has the same effect as applying it once, then it is idempotent. For example, setting a user's age to 30 using PATCH is idempotent, but incrementing a counter by 1 is not idempotent.
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
// Simulating a simple key-value store
class KeyValueStore {
    private Map<String, String> store = new HashMap<>();

    // PUT operation (idempotent)
    public void put(String key, String value) {
        store.put(key, value);
    }

    // GET operation (idempotent)
    public String get(String key) {
        return store.get(key);
    }

    // DELETE operation (idempotent)
    public void delete(String key) {
        store.remove(key);
    }
}
// Main class to demonstrate idempotence
public class IdempotenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KeyValueStore kvStore = new KeyValueStore();

        // PUT operation
        kvStore.put("key1", "value1");
        System.out.println("After first PUT: " + kvStore.get("key1")); // Output: value1

        // Repeating the same PUT operation (idempotent)
        kvStore.put("key1", "value1");
        System.out.println("After second PUT: " + kvStore.get("key1")); // Output: value1

        // DELETE operation
        kvStore.delete("key1");
        System.out.println("After DELETE: " + kvStore.get("key1")); // Output: null

        // Repeating the same DELETE operation (idempotent)
        kvStore.delete("key1");
        System.out.println("After second DELETE: " + kvStore.get("key1")); // Output: null
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `KeyValueStore` class simulates a simple key-value store with `put`, `get`, and `delete` methods.
- The `put` method is idempotent because calling it multiple times with the same key and value does not change the state after the first call.
- The `delete` method is also idempotent because calling it multiple times on the same key has the same effect as calling it once.
- The `get` method is idempotent as well, as it simply retrieves the value without modifying the state.
- The example demonstrates that the state of the key-value store remains consistent regardless of how many times the idempotent operations are performed.
// Main class to test the custom annotation
public class CustomAnnotationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotatedClass annotatedClass = new AnnotatedClass();
        annotatedClass.annotatedMethod(); // Call the annotated method

        // Accessing the custom annotation
        CustomAnnotation annotation = null;
        try {
            annotation = annotatedClass.getClass()
                    .getMethod("annotatedMethod")
                    .getAnnotation(CustomAnnotation.class);
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Custom Annotation Value: " + annotation.value());
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `CustomAnnotation` is defined with a retention policy of `RUNTIME`, meaning it will be available at runtime, and it can be applied to methods.
- The `AnnotatedClass` class has a method `annotatedMethod()` that is annotated with `CustomAnnotation`.
- The `CustomAnnotationExample` class demonstrates how to use the custom annotation by calling the annotated method and accessing its value using reflection.
- The output shows the value of the custom annotation when the method is called.
In summary, custom annotations in Java allow developers to create their own metadata that can be applied to classes, methods, fields, and other program elements. They can be used for various purposes, such as documentation, code analysis, and runtime processing.
This example illustrates how to create and use a custom annotation in Java, allowing for better organization and management of metadata in your applications.
```java

}
// Class to demonstrate the use of custom annotation
class AnnotatedClass {
    @CustomAnnotation(value = "Custom Annotation Example")
    public void annotatedMethod() {
        System.out.println("This method is annotated with CustomAnnotation.");
    }
}
// Main class to test the custom annotation
public class CustomAnnotationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotatedClass annotatedClass = new AnnotatedClass();
        annotatedClass.annotatedMethod(); // Call the annotated method

        // Accessing the custom annotation
        CustomAnnotation annotation = null;
        try {
            annotation = annotatedClass.getClass()
                    .getMethod("annotatedMethod")
                    .getAnnotation(CustomAnnotation.class);
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Custom Annotation Value: " + annotation.value());
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `CustomAnnotation` is defined with a retention policy of `RUNTIME`, meaning it will be available at runtime, and it can be applied to methods.
- The `AnnotatedClass` class has a method `annotatedMethod()` that is annotated with `CustomAnnotation`.

13. what is volatile in java?
=========================================================
The `volatile` keyword in Java is a modifier that can be applied to instance variables. It indicates that the variable's value may be changed by different threads, and it ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads. Here are the key points about `volatile`:
1. **Visibility**: When a variable is declared as `volatile`, it guarantees that any thread reading the variable will see the most recent write to that variable by any other thread. This means that changes made to a `volatile` variable are immediately visible to all threads.
2. **No Caching**: The `volatile` keyword prevents the compiler and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from caching the variable's value in registers or local memory. Instead, it always reads the value from main memory.
3. **Atomicity**: The `volatile` keyword does not guarantee atomicity of operations. For example, if you have a `volatile` variable and you perform a read-modify-write operation (like incrementing), it is not atomic. You may still need to use synchronization mechanisms (like `synchronized` blocks or `Lock`) for compound actions.
4. **Use Cases**: The `volatile` keyword is typically used for flags or state variables that are accessed by multiple threads. It is useful when you want to ensure that a variable's value is always up-to-date without using synchronization.
5. **Example**:
```java
class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void setFlag() {
        flag = true; // Set the flag to true
    }

    public boolean isFlagSet() {
        return flag; // Read the flag value
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VolatileExample example = new VolatileExample();

        // Thread to set the flag
        Thread setterThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate some work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            example.setFlag();
            System.out.println("Flag set to true");
        });

        // Thread to check the flag
        Thread checkerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!example.isFlagSet()) {
                // Busy-wait until the flag is set
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is set: " + example.isFlagSet());
        });

        setterThread.start();
        checkerThread.start();
    }
}
```
In this example:
- The `flag` variable is declared as `volatile`, ensuring that changes to it are visible across threads.

- The `setterThread` sets the flag to `true` after a delay, while the `checkerThread` continuously checks the flag's value.
- The `checkerThread` will see the updated value of `flag` as soon as it is set by the `setterThread`, demonstrating the visibility guarantee provided by the `volatile` keyword.
- The output will show that the flag is set to `true` after the setter thread updates it, and the checker thread will print the updated value.
- The `volatile` keyword is useful in scenarios where you need to ensure that a variable's value is always up-to-date across multiple threads without using synchronization.
