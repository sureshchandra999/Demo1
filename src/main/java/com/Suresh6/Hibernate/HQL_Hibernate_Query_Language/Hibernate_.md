Hibernate:
==========
Hibernate is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java.
It provides a way to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa, allowing developers to work with
databases using Java objects instead of SQL queries.
Hibernate simplifies database interactions and provides features like caching, lazy loading, and
transaction management. It is widely used in Java applications to handle data persistence and retrieval efficiently.
Hibernate is often used in conjunction with Java EE or Spring frameworks to build robust and scalable applications. It supports various database systems and provides a powerful query language called HQL (Hibernate Query Language) for querying data.
Hibernate is an open-source project and is part of the Java EE ecosystem. It is maintained by Red Hat and has a large community of contributors and users.
Hibernate is a popular choice for developers who want to work with databases in a more object-oriented way, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for database operations.
Hibernate is also known for its ability to handle complex relationships between entities, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, making it a versatile tool for data modeling.

Hibernate Architecture:
=================================
Hibernate architecture consists of several components that work together to provide a powerful ORM framework. The main components of Hibernate architecture include:
1. **Configuration**: This component is responsible for configuring Hibernate settings, such as database connection properties, mapping files, and caching settings. It typically uses an XML configuration file (hibernate.cfg.xml) or Java-based configuration.
2. **SessionFactory**: The SessionFactory is a thread-safe object that creates and manages sessions. It is responsible for establishing connections to the database and providing session instances for performing CRUD operations. The SessionFactory is typically created once during application startup and reused throughout the application.
3. **Session**: A Session is a single-threaded, short-lived object that represents a conversation between the application and the database. It is used to perform CRUD operations, manage transactions, and query the database. Sessions are not thread-safe and should be used within a single thread.
