SpringBoot Interview Questions:
====================================

1. What is Spring Boot and how does it differ from the Spring Framework?
   - Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications. It provides defaults for code and annotation configuration to reduce boilerplate code, and it includes embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
2. What are the main features of Spring Boot?
    - Some main features of Spring Boot include:
      - Auto-configuration
      - Standalone applications
      - Embedded servers
      - Production-ready features (e.g., health checks, metrics)
      - Opinionated defaults
      - Easy dependency management with Spring Boot Starter POMs
3. How do you create a Spring Boot application?
    - You can create a Spring Boot application using the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to generate a project structure, or you can manually set up a Maven or Gradle project with the necessary dependencies. The main class should be annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and contain a `main` method that calls `SpringApplication.run()`.
4. What is the purpose of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?
Answer:
   - The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is a convenience annotation that combines three annotations: `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It indicates that the class is a Spring Boot application and enables auto-configuration and component scanning in the package where the class is located.
5. What is auto-configuration in Spring Boot?
    - Auto-configuration in Spring Boot is a feature that automatically configures Spring beans based on the dependencies present in the classpath. It attempts to guess and configure beans you are likely to need, reducing the need for manual configuration. This is done through conditional annotations like `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, etc.
6. How can you customize the auto-configuration in Spring Boot?
    - You can customize auto-configuration in Spring Boot by:
      - Using properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml` files to override default settings.
      - Creating your own configuration classes with `@Configuration` and defining beans that will override the auto-configured beans.
      - Excluding specific auto-configuration classes using the `exclude` attribute of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation or the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation.
7. What is the purpose of the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file in Spring Boot?
    - The `application.properties` or `application.yml` file is used to define configuration properties for a Spring Boot application. It allows you to set various application settings, such as server port, database connection details, logging levels, and other custom properties. Spring Boot automatically loads these files and applies the configurations at runtime.
8. How do you define a RESTful web service in Spring Boot?
    - You can define a RESTful web service in Spring Boot by creating a controller class annotated with `@RestController`. You can then define methods within this class that handle HTTP requests using annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping`. Each method can return a response body, which will be automatically serialized to JSON or XML based on the content type requested.
9. What is the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController` in Spring Boot?
    - The `@Controller` annotation is used to define a Spring MVC controller that handles web requests and returns views (typically JSPs or Thymeleaf templates). In contrast, `@RestController` is a specialized version of `@Controller` that combines `@ResponseBody`, meaning it automatically serializes the return value of methods to JSON or XML without needing to annotate each method with `@ResponseBody`. It is typically used for RESTful web services.
10. How do you handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations. `@ControllerAdvice` allows you to define global exception handling logic, while `@ExceptionHandler` can be used to handle specific exceptions within a controller or globally. You can also use the `ResponseEntity` class to return custom error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
11. What is Spring Boot Actuator and what are its main features?
    - Spring Boot Actuator is a sub-project of Spring Boot that provides production-ready features to help monitor and manage your application. Its main features include:
      - Endpoints for health checks, metrics, and application information
      - Customizable endpoints
      - Integration with external monitoring systems
      - Ability to expose sensitive information securely
      - Support for environment properties and configuration management
12. How do you enable Spring Boot Actuator in your application?
    - To enable Spring Boot Actuator, you need to add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to your project. If you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:
      ```xml
      <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      ```
      After adding the dependency, you can configure actuator endpoints in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
13. What are some common actuator endpoints and their purposes?
    - Some common actuator endpoints include:
      - `/actuator/health`: Provides health status of the application.
      - `/actuator/metrics`: Exposes various application metrics, such as memory usage, request counts, etc.
      - `/actuator/info`: Displays arbitrary application information, such as build version and description.
      - `/actuator/env`: Exposes environment properties and configuration settings.
      - `/actuator/loggers`: Allows you to view and modify logging levels at runtime.
14. How do you secure a Spring Boot application?
    - You can secure a Spring Boot application using Spring Security. To do this, you need to add the `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency to your project. You can then configure security settings in a class annotated with `@Configuration` and `@EnableWebSecurity`. You can define user roles, authentication mechanisms (e.g., in-memory, JDBC, OAuth2), and access control rules for different endpoints.
15. What is the purpose of the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation?
    - The `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation is used to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It tells Spring Boot to automatically configure beans based on the dependencies present in the classpath. This annotation is typically included in the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which combines it with `@Configuration` and `@ComponentScan`.
16. How do you create a custom starter in Spring Boot?
    - To create a custom starter in Spring Boot, you need to:
      1. Create a new Maven or Gradle project.
      2. Define the necessary dependencies in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
      3. Create configuration classes annotated with `@Configuration` that define beans and properties.
      4. Package the project as a JAR file.
      5. Include the custom starter in other Spring Boot applications by adding it as a dependency.
      6. Optionally, provide auto-configuration using `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, etc.
17. What is the purpose of the `@ConditionalOnClass` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@ConditionalOnClass` annotation is used in Spring Boot's auto-configuration to conditionally enable a configuration class or bean based on the presence of a specific class in the classpath. If the specified class is found, the annotated configuration will be applied; otherwise, it will be ignored. This allows for flexible and modular configuration based on available dependencies.
18. How do you externalize configuration in Spring Boot?
    - You can externalize configuration in Spring Boot using properties files (`application.properties` or `application.yml`), environment variables, command-line arguments, or configuration files located in the classpath. Spring Boot automatically loads these configurations and allows you to access them using the `@Value` annotation or by binding them to a configuration properties class annotated with `@ConfigurationProperties`.
19. What is the purpose of the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation is used to bind external configuration properties (from `application.properties`, `application.yml`, or other sources) to a Java class. It allows you to group related properties together and access them in a type-safe manner. You can specify a prefix for the properties, and Spring Boot will automatically map the properties to the fields of the annotated class.
20. How do you implement caching in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement caching in a Spring Boot application by using the `@EnableCaching` annotation in a configuration class. You also need to add a caching provider dependency, such as Ehcache, Caffeine, or Redis. You can then use the `@Cacheable`, `@CachePut`, and `@CacheEvict` annotations on methods to define caching behavior. The `@Cacheable` annotation is used to cache the result of a method, while `@CachePut` updates the cache with the method's result, and `@CacheEvict` removes entries from the cache.
21. What is the difference between `@Cacheable` and `@CachePut` annotations in Spring Boot?
    - The `@Cacheable` annotation is used to cache the result of a method. If the method is called with the same parameters, the cached result is returned instead of executing the method again. In contrast, the `@CachePut` annotation is used to update the cache with the result of a method execution, regardless of whether the method was previously cached. This means that `@CachePut` always executes the method and updates the cache with its result.
22. How do you configure a data source in Spring Boot?
    - You can configure a data source in Spring Boot by adding the necessary database driver dependency (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL) to your project. Then, you can define the data source properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, such as:
      ```properties
      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
      spring.datasource.username=myuser
      spring.datasource.password=mypassword
      spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
      ```
      Spring Boot will automatically configure the data source based on these properties.
23. What is the purpose of the `@Entity` annotation in Spring Boot?
Answer:
   - The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark a Java class as a JPA entity, which means it represents a table in the database. When you annotate a class with `@Entity`, Spring Boot will automatically map the class to a database table and manage its persistence using JPA (Java Persistence API). Each instance of the entity class corresponds to a row in the table.
24. How do you perform database migrations in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can perform database migrations in a Spring Boot application using tools like Flyway or Liquibase. These tools allow you to define migration scripts (SQL or XML) that will be executed automatically when the application starts. You need to add the appropriate dependency (e.g., `flyway-core` or `liquibase-core`) and configure the migration settings in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
25. What is the purpose of the `@Autowired` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject dependencies into Spring beans. It allows Spring to automatically resolve and inject the required bean into the annotated field, constructor, or method. This is part of Spring's dependency injection mechanism, which promotes loose coupling and easier testing by allowing you to manage dependencies through the Spring container.
26. How do you define a scheduled task in Spring Boot?
    - You can define a scheduled task in Spring Boot by using the `@Scheduled` annotation. First, you need to enable scheduling by adding the `@EnableScheduling` annotation to a configuration class. Then, you can create a method annotated with `@Scheduled`, specifying the scheduling parameters such as fixed rate, fixed delay, or cron expression. For example:
      ```java
      @Configuration
      @EnableScheduling
      public class SchedulerConfig {
          @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
          public void performTask() {
              // Task logic here
          }
      }
      ```
27. What is the purpose of the `@EnableScheduling` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@EnableScheduling` annotation is used to enable the scheduling support in a Spring Boot application. When this annotation is added to a configuration class, it allows you to define scheduled tasks using the `@Scheduled` annotation. This enables the application to execute methods at specified intervals or according to cron expressions, facilitating background processing and periodic tasks.
28. How do you implement internationalization (i18n) in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement internationalization (i18n) in a Spring Boot application by using message resource bundles. You need to create properties files for each locale (e.g., `messages.properties`, `messages_en.properties`, `messages_fr.properties`) and place them in the `src/main/resources` directory. Then, you can use the `MessageSource` interface to access these messages in your controllers or services. Additionally, you can configure the default locale and supported locales in the `application.properties` file:
      ```properties
      spring.messages.basename=messages
      spring.messages.cache-duration=3600
      spring.messages.encoding=UTF-8
      ```
29. How do you handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can handle CORS in a Spring Boot application by using the `@CrossOrigin` annotation on your controller methods or classes. This annotation allows you to specify which origins are allowed to access the resources. Alternatively, you can configure global CORS settings by implementing the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface and overriding the `addCorsMappings` method:
      ```java
      @Configuration
      public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
          @Override
          public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
              registry.addMapping("/**")
                      .allowedOrigins("http://example.com")
                      .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE");
          }
      }
      ```
30. What is the purpose of the `@Value` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@Value` annotation is used to inject values from configuration properties (such as those defined in `application.properties` or `application.yml`) into Spring beans. It allows you to access configuration values directly in your code. For example, you can use it to inject a property value into a field or method parameter:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class MyComponent {
            @Value("${my.custom.property}")
            private String myProperty;

            public void printProperty() {
                 System.out.println(myProperty);
            }
      }
      ```
31. How do you implement file upload functionality in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement file upload functionality in a Spring Boot application by using the `@MultipartFile` interface. First, you need to add the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency to your project. Then, you can create a controller method that accepts a file upload request. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @RestController
      public class FileUploadController {
          @PostMapping("/upload")
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleFileUpload(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
              if (file.isEmpty()) {
                  return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("File is empty");
              }
              // Process the file (e.g., save it to disk)
              return ResponseEntity.ok("File uploaded successfully: " + file.getOriginalFilename());
          }
      }
      ```
32. What is the purpose of the `@Bean` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@Bean` annotation is used to declare a bean in a Spring application context. It indicates that a method produces a bean that should be managed by the Spring container. When you annotate a method with `@Bean`, Spring will call that method and register the returned object as a bean in the application context, making it available for dependency injection throughout the application.
33. How do you implement pagination and sorting in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement pagination and sorting in a Spring Boot application by using the `Pageable` interface provided by Spring Data JPA. In your repository interface, you can define methods that accept a `Pageable` parameter. For example:
      ```java
      @Repository
      public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
          Page<User> findAll(Pageable pageable);
      }
      ```
      In your service or controller, you can create a `PageRequest` object to specify the page number, size, and sorting criteria:
      ```java
      @GetMapping("/users")
      public Page<User> getUsers(@RequestParam int page, @RequestParam int size) {
          Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, Sort.by("name").ascending());
          return userRepository.findAll(pageable);
      }
      ```
34. How do you implement a custom health indicator in Spring Boot Actuator?
    - You can implement a custom health indicator in Spring Boot Actuator by creating a class that implements the `HealthIndicator` interface. You need to override the `health()` method to provide the health check logic. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
          @Override
          public Health health() {
              // Perform custom health check logic
              boolean isHealthy = checkSomeServiceHealth();
              if (isHealthy) {
                  return Health.up().withDetail("Custom Service", "Service is healthy").build();
              } else {
                  return Health.down().withDetail("Custom Service", "Service is down").build();
              }
          }

          private boolean checkSomeServiceHealth() {
              // Logic to check service health
              return true; // or false based on the health check
          }
      }
      ```
      After implementing this, your custom health indicator will be available at the `/actuator/health` endpoint.
35. How do you configure logging in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can configure logging in a Spring Boot application using the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. By default, Spring Boot uses Logback as the logging framework. You can set the logging level, specify log file locations, and customize the log format. For example:
      ```properties
      logging.level.root=INFO
      logging.level.org.springframework.web=DEBUG
      logging.file.name=logs/myapp.log
      logging.pattern.console=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} - %msg%n
      ```
      You can also create a custom `logback-spring.xml` file for more advanced configurations.
36. What is the purpose of the `@ComponentScan` annotation in Spring Boot?
    - The `@ComponentScan` annotation is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components (e.g., `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`). It allows Spring to automatically discover and register these components in the application context. By default, `@SpringBootApplication` includes `@ComponentScan`, which scans the package where the main application class is located and its sub-packages. You can customize the base packages by providing the `basePackages` attribute.
37. How do you implement a custom converter in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom converter in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `Converter` interface from the Spring Framework. You need to override the `convert` method to define the conversion logic. After implementing the converter, you can register it as a Spring bean. Here's an example of a custom converter that converts a String to a LocalDate:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class StringToLocalDateConverter implements Converter<String, LocalDate> {
          @Override
          public LocalDate convert(String source) {
              return LocalDate.parse(source, DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE);
          }
      }
      ```
      Once registered, this converter will be automatically used by Spring when converting request parameters or model attributes.
38. How do you implement a custom filter in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement a custom filter in a Spring Boot application by creating a class that implements the `Filter` interface. You need to override the `doFilter` method to define the filtering logic. After implementing the filter, you can register it as a Spring bean using the `@Component` annotation or by defining it in a configuration class. Here's an example of a custom filter that logs request details:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomFilter implements Filter {
          @Override
          public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
                  throws IOException, ServletException {
              HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;
              System.out.println("Request URI: " + httpRequest.getRequestURI());
              chain.doFilter(request, response); // Continue with the next filter or resource
          }
      }
      ```
      This filter will be applied to all incoming requests in the application.
39. How do you implement a custom interceptor in a Spring Boot application?
    - You can implement a custom interceptor in a Spring Boot application by creating a class that implements the `HandlerInterceptor` interface. You need to override methods like `preHandle`, `postHandle`, and `afterCompletion` to define the interception logic. After implementing the interceptor, you can register it in a configuration class by overriding the `addInterceptors` method of the `WebMvcConfigurer` interface. Here's an example of a custom interceptor that logs request details:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {
          @Override
          public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)
                  throws Exception {
              System.out.println("Pre Handle: " + request.getRequestURI());
              return true; // Continue with the next interceptor or handler
          }

          @Override
          public void postHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
                                 ModelAndView modelAndView) throws Exception {
              System.out.println("Post Handle: " + request.getRequestURI());
          }

          @Override
          public void afterCompletion(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler,
                                      Exception ex) throws Exception {
              System.out.println("After Completion: " + request.getRequestURI());
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
          @Override
          public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
              registry.addInterceptor(new CustomInterceptor());
          }
      }
      ```
      This interceptor will be applied to all incoming requests in the application.
40. How do you implement a custom authentication provider in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom authentication provider in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `AuthenticationProvider` interface. You need to override the `authenticate` method to define the authentication logic and the `supports` method to specify which authentication token types are supported. After implementing the provider, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example of a custom authentication provider:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomAuthenticationProvider implements AuthenticationProvider {
          @Override
          public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException {
              String username = authentication.getName();
              String password = (String) authentication.getCredentials();

              // Custom authentication logic (e.g., check against a database)
              if ("user".equals(username) && "password".equals(password)) {
                  return new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password, new ArrayList<>());
              } else {
                  throw new BadCredentialsException("Invalid username or password");
              }
          }

          @Override
          public boolean supports(Class<?> authentication) {
              return UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.class.isAssignableFrom(authentication);
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomAuthenticationProvider customAuthenticationProvider;

          @Override
          protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
              auth.authenticationProvider(customAuthenticationProvider);
          }

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .httpBasic();
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom authentication provider checks for a hardcoded username and password, but you can replace this logic with your own authentication mechanism.
41. How do you implement a custom user details service in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom user details service in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `UserDetailsService` interface. You need to override the `loadUserByUsername` method to define how to retrieve user details based on the username. After implementing the service, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example of a custom user details service:
      ```java
      @Service
      public class CustomUserDetailsService implements UserDetailsService {
          @Override
          public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
              // Custom logic to retrieve user from a database or other source
              if ("user".equals(username)) {
                  return new User("user", "{noop}password", new ArrayList<>()); // {noop} indicates no password encoding
              } else {
                  throw new UsernameNotFoundException("User not found: " + username);
              }
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomUserDetailsService customUserDetailsService;

          @Override
          protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
              auth.userDetailsService(customUserDetailsService).passwordEncoder(NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance());
          }

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .httpBasic();
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom user details service retrieves a hardcoded user, but you can replace this logic with your own user retrieval mechanism from a database or other sources.
42. How do you implement a custom password encoder in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom password encoder in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `PasswordEncoder` interface. You need to override the `encode` and `matches` methods to define how passwords are encoded and matched. After implementing the encoder, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example of a custom password encoder:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomPasswordEncoder implements PasswordEncoder {
          @Override
          public String encode(CharSequence rawPassword) {
              // Custom logic to encode the password (e.g., hashing)
              return "encoded_" + rawPassword; // Example encoding
          }

          @Override
          public boolean matches(CharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword) {
              // Custom logic to match the raw password with the encoded password
              return encodedPassword.equals(encode(rawPassword));
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomPasswordEncoder customPasswordEncoder;

          @Override
          protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
              auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                      .withUser("user")
                      .password(customPasswordEncoder.encode("password"))
                      .roles("USER");
          }

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .httpBasic();
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom password encoder simply prefixes "encoded_" to the raw password, but you can replace this logic with your own encoding mechanism.
43. How do you implement a custom authentication filter in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom authentication filter in Spring Boot by creating a class that extends `OncePerRequestFilter` or `AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter`. You need to override the `doFilterInternal` method to define the authentication logic. After implementing the filter, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example of a custom authentication filter:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomAuthenticationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {
          @Override
          protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
                  throws ServletException, IOException {
              String username = request.getParameter("username");
              String password = request.getParameter("password");

              if (username != null && password != null) {
                  // Custom authentication logic (e.g., check against a database)
                  if ("user".equals(username) && "password".equals(password)) {
                      UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken auth = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);
                      SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(auth);
                  } else {
                      response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, "Invalid credentials");
                      return;
                  }
              }

              filterChain.doFilter(request, response); // Continue with the next filter or resource
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomAuthenticationFilter customAuthenticationFilter;

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.addFilterBefore(customAuthenticationFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
                      .authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .httpBasic();
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom authentication filter checks for hardcoded credentials and sets the authentication in the security context if they are valid. You can replace this logic with your own authentication mechanism.
44. How do you implement a custom authentication success handler in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom authentication success handler in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `AuthenticationSuccessHandler` interface. You need to override the `onAuthenticationSuccess` method to define the logic that should be executed when authentication is successful. After implementing the handler, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler implements AuthenticationSuccessHandler {
          @Override
          public void onAuthenticationSuccess(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
                                              Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {
              // Custom logic after successful authentication (e.g., logging, redirecting)
              System.out.println("Authentication successful for user: " + authentication.getName());
              response.sendRedirect("/home"); // Redirect to home page
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomAuthenticationSuccessHandler customAuthenticationSuccessHandler;

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .formLogin()
                      .successHandler(customAuthenticationSuccessHandler); // Register custom success handler
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom authentication success handler logs the username and redirects the user to the home page after successful authentication. You can replace this logic with your own requirements.
45. How do you implement a custom authentication failure handler in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom authentication failure handler in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `AuthenticationFailureHandler` interface. You need to override the `onAuthenticationFailure` method to define the logic that should be executed when authentication fails. After implementing the handler, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomAuthenticationFailureHandler implements AuthenticationFailureHandler {
          @Override
          public void onAuthenticationFailure(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
                                              AuthenticationException exception) throws IOException, ServletException {
              // Custom logic after failed authentication (e.g., logging, sending error response)
              System.out.println("Authentication failed: " + exception.getMessage());
              response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, "Authentication failed: " + exception.getMessage());
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomAuthenticationFailureHandler customAuthenticationFailureHandler;

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .formLogin()
                      .failureHandler(customAuthenticationFailureHandler); // Register custom failure handler
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom authentication failure handler logs the error message and sends an unauthorized response when authentication fails. You can replace this logic with your own requirements.
46. How do you implement a custom logout handler in Spring Boot?
Answer:
    - You can implement a custom logout handler in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `LogoutHandler` interface. You need to override the `logout` method to define the logic that should be executed when a user logs out. After implementing the handler, you can register it in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomLogoutHandler implements LogoutHandler {
          @Override
          public void logout(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Authentication authentication) {
              // Custom logic after logout (e.g., logging, cleaning up resources)
              System.out.println("User logged out: " + (authentication != null ? authentication.getName() : "Anonymous"));
          }
      }

      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Autowired
          private CustomLogoutHandler customLogoutHandler;

          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .logout()
                      .addLogoutHandler(customLogoutHandler) // Register custom logout handler
                      .logoutSuccessUrl("/login?logout"); // Redirect after logout
          }
      }
      ```
      This custom logout handler logs the username of the user who logged out and can perform additional cleanup tasks as needed. You can replace this logic with your own requirements.
47. How do you implement a custom session management strategy in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom session management strategy in Spring Boot by configuring the session management settings in a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. You can use the `sessionManagement()` method to define how sessions should be handled, such as setting the session creation policy, maximum sessions per user, and session fixation protection. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Configuration
      @EnableWebSecurity
      public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
          @Override
          protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
              http.authorizeRequests()
                      .anyRequest().authenticated()
                      .and()
                      .sessionManagement()
                      .sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.IF_REQUIRED) // Create session if needed
                      .maximumSessions(1) // Limit to one session per user
                      .maxSessionsPreventsLogin(true) // Prevent new login if max sessions reached
                      .and()
                      .sessionFixation().migrateSession(); // Migrate session on login
          }
      }
      ```
      This configuration sets the session creation policy to create a session only if required, limits the number of concurrent sessions per user to one, and migrates the session on login to prevent session fixation attacks. You can customize these settings based on your application's requirements.
48. How do you implement a custom request mapping in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom request mapping in Spring Boot by creating a method in a controller class and annotating it with `@RequestMapping` or one of its specialized annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. You can specify the URL path, HTTP method, and other parameters in the annotation. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @RestController
      public class CustomController {
          @RequestMapping(value = "/custom", method = RequestMethod.GET)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomRequest() {
              return ResponseEntity.ok("This is a custom request mapping");
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `handleCustomRequest` method will handle GET requests to the `/custom` URL path. You can customize the path and HTTP method as needed.
49. How do you implement a custom response body advice in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom response body advice in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `ResponseBodyAdvice` interface. You need to override the `supports` method to specify which response types you want to advise and the `beforeBodyWrite` method to modify the response body before it is written. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomResponseBodyAdvice implements ResponseBodyAdvice<Object> {
          @Override
          public boolean supports(MethodParameter returnType, Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType) {
              // Indicate that this advice applies to all response types
              return true;
          }

          @Override
          public Object beforeBodyWrite(Object body, MethodParameter returnType, MediaType selectedContentType,
                                         Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> selectedConverterType,
                                         ServerHttpRequest request, ServerHttpResponse response) {
              // Modify the response body (e.g., wrap it in a custom response object)
              return new CustomResponse(body);
          }
      }

      public class CustomResponse {
          private Object data;

          public CustomResponse(Object data) {
              this.data = data;
          }

          public Object getData() {
              return data;
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomResponseBodyAdvice` modifies the response body by wrapping it in a `CustomResponse` object. You can customize the logic in the `beforeBodyWrite` method as needed.
50. How do you implement a custom request body advice in Spring Boot?
Answer:
    - You can implement a custom request body advice in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `RequestBodyAdvice` interface. You need to override the `supports` method to specify which request types you want to advise and the `beforeBodyRead` method to modify the request body before it is read. Here's an example:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomRequestBodyAdvice implements RequestBodyAdvice {
          @Override
          public boolean supports(MethodParameter methodParameter, Type targetType, Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType) {
              // Indicate that this advice applies to all request types
              return true;
          }

          @Override
          public Object beforeBodyRead(Object body, MethodParameter methodParameter, Type targetType,
                                       Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType,
                                       ServerHttpRequest request) {
              // Modify the request body (e.g., log it or transform it)
              System.out.println("Received request body: " + body);
              return body; // Return the original body or a modified version
          }

          @Override
          public Object afterBodyRead(Object body, MethodParameter methodParameter, Type targetType,
                                      Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType,
                                      ServerHttpRequest request) {
              return body; // Return the original body or a modified version
          }

          @Override
          public Object handleEmptyBody(Object body, MethodParameter methodParameter, Type targetType,
                                        Class<? extends HttpMessageConverter<?>> converterType,
                                        ServerHttpRequest request) {
              return body; // Handle empty body if needed
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomRequestBodyAdvice` logs the received request body before it is processed. You can customize the logic in the `beforeBodyRead` method as needed.
51. How do you implement a custom exception resolver in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom exception resolver in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `HandlerExceptionResolver` interface or by using the `@ControllerAdvice` annotation with `@ExceptionHandler`. The `HandlerExceptionResolver` allows you to define how exceptions should be resolved globally, while `@ControllerAdvice` provides a way to handle exceptions in a more declarative manner. Here's an example using `@ControllerAdvice`:
      ```java
      @ControllerAdvice
      public class CustomExceptionResolver {
          @ExceptionHandler(CustomException.class)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomException(CustomException ex) {
              // Custom logic to handle the exception
              return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body("Custom error: " + ex.getMessage());
          }

          @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleGeneralException(Exception ex) {
              // Handle general exceptions
              return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
          }
      }

      public class CustomException extends RuntimeException {
          public CustomException(String message) {
              super(message);
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomExceptionResolver` handles `CustomException` and general exceptions, returning appropriate HTTP responses. You can customize the logic in the exception handlers as needed.
52. How do you implement a custom error page in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom error page in Spring Boot by creating an HTML file in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory (if you are using Thymeleaf) or in the `src/main/resources/static` directory (for static content). You can also define a controller method to handle specific error codes. Here's an example of creating a custom error page for HTTP 404 errors:
      1. Create an HTML file named `error-404.html` in the `src/main/resources/templates` directory:
      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
      <head>
          <meta charset="UTF-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          <title>Page Not Found</title>
      </head>
      <body>
          <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
          <p>The page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
      </body>
      </html>
      ```
      2. Create a controller method to handle the 404 error:
      ```java
      @Controller
      public class ErrorController {
          @RequestMapping("/error")
          public String handleError() {
              return "error-404"; // Return the name of the custom error page
          }
      }
      ```
      3. Optionally, you can configure the error handling in the `application.properties` file:
      ```properties
      server.error.whitelabel.enabled=false
      ```
      This will disable the default Whitelabel error page and allow your custom error page to be displayed.
53. How do you implement a custom view resolver in Spring Boot?
Answer:
    - You can implement a custom view resolver in Spring Boot by creating a class that extends `ViewResolver` and overrides the `resolveViewName` method. You can then register this view resolver as a Spring bean. Here's an example of a custom view resolver that resolves view names to Thymeleaf templates:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomViewResolver implements ViewResolver {
          @Override
          public View resolveViewName(String viewName, Locale locale) throws Exception {
              // Custom logic to resolve the view name to a Thymeleaf template
              String templateName = "templates/" + viewName + ".html"; // Assuming templates are in src/main/resources/templates
              return new ThymeleafView(templateName);
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomViewResolver` resolves view names by appending `.html` to the name and looking for the corresponding Thymeleaf template. You can customize the logic based on your application's requirements.
54. How do you implement a custom message converter in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom message converter in Spring Boot by creating a class that extends `AbstractHttpMessageConverter` or implements the `HttpMessageConverter` interface. You need to override methods like `canRead`, `canWrite`, `readInternal`, and `writeInternal` to define how to read and write messages. After implementing the converter, you can register it as a Spring bean. Here's an example of a custom message converter that handles JSON:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomJsonMessageConverter extends AbstractHttpMessageConverter<Object> {
          public CustomJsonMessageConverter() {
              super(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON); // Specify the media type this converter supports
          }

          @Override
          protected boolean canRead(Class<?> clazz, MediaType mediaType) {
              return true; // Indicate that this converter can read any class
          }

          @Override
          protected boolean canWrite(Class<?> clazz, MediaType mediaType) {
              return true; // Indicate that this converter can write any class
          }

          @Override
          protected Object readInternal(Class<?> clazz, HttpInputMessage inputMessage) throws IOException {
              // Custom logic to read JSON from the input message
              ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
              return objectMapper.readValue(inputMessage.getBody(), clazz);
          }

          @Override
          protected void writeInternal(Object object, HttpOutputMessage outputMessage) throws IOException {
              // Custom logic to write JSON to the output message
              ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
              objectMapper.writeValue(outputMessage.getBody(), object);
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomJsonMessageConverter` reads and writes JSON using Jackson's `ObjectMapper`. You can customize the logic based on your application's requirements.
55. How do you implement a custom request mapping handler in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom request mapping handler in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` interface or extends the `AbstractHandlerMethodMapping` class. You can override methods like `getHandlerInternal` to define how to map requests to handler methods. However, a more common approach is to use the `@RequestMapping` annotation on controller methods. Here's an example of a custom request mapping handler using `@RequestMapping`:
      ```java
      @RestController
      public class CustomController {
          @RequestMapping(value = "/custom", method = RequestMethod.GET)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomRequest() {
              return ResponseEntity.ok("This is a custom request mapping");
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `handleCustomRequest` method will handle GET requests to the `/custom` URL path. You can customize the path and HTTP method as needed.
56. How do you implement a custom request mapping condition in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom request mapping condition in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `RequestCondition` interface. You need to override methods like `getMatchingCondition` and `combine` to define the logic for matching requests based on specific conditions. After implementing the condition, you can use it with the `@RequestMapping` annotation. Here's an example of a custom request mapping condition that checks for a specific header:
      ```java
      public class CustomHeaderCondition implements RequestCondition<CustomHeaderCondition> {
          private final String headerName;

          public CustomHeaderCondition(String headerName) {
              this.headerName = headerName;
          }

          @Override
          public CustomHeaderCondition combine(CustomHeaderCondition other) {
              return new CustomHeaderCondition(this.headerName); // Combine logic if needed
          }

          @Override
          public CustomHeaderCondition getMatchingCondition(HttpServletRequest request) {
              if (request.getHeader(headerName) != null) {
                  return this; // Return this condition if the header is present
              }
              return null; // No match
          }

          @Override
          public int compareTo(CustomHeaderCondition other, HttpServletRequest request) {
              return 0; // Comparison logic if needed
          }
      }

      @RestController
      public class CustomController {
          @RequestMapping(value = "/custom", method = RequestMethod.GET, headers = "X-Custom-Header")
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomRequest() {
              return ResponseEntity.ok("This is a custom request mapping with a header condition");
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomHeaderCondition` checks for the presence of a specific header (`X-Custom-Header`) in the request. If the header is present, the request will be handled by the `handleCustomRequest` method.
57. How do you implement a custom request mapping handler adapter in Spring Boot?
    - You can implement a custom request mapping handler adapter in Spring Boot by creating a class that implements the `HandlerAdapter` interface. You need to override methods like `supports`, `handle`, and `getLastModified` to define how to handle requests with your custom adapter. After implementing the adapter, you can register it as a Spring bean. Here's an example of a custom request mapping handler adapter:
      ```java
      @Component
      public class CustomHandlerAdapter implements HandlerAdapter {
          @Override
          public boolean supports(Object handler) {
              return handler instanceof CustomController; // Indicate that this adapter supports CustomController
          }

          @Override
          public ModelAndView handle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler)
                  throws Exception {
              CustomController customController = (CustomController) handler;
              return customController.handleCustomRequest(); // Call the controller method
          }

          @Override
          public long getLastModified(HttpServletRequest request, Object handler) {
              return -1; // Return -1 if not applicable
          }
      }

      @RestController
      public class CustomController {
          @RequestMapping(value = "/custom", method = RequestMethod.GET)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleCustomRequest() {
              return ResponseEntity.ok("This is a custom request mapping handled by a custom adapter");
          }
      }
      ```
      In this example, the `CustomHandlerAdapter` checks if the handler is an instance of `CustomController` and calls its `handleCustomRequest` method when handling requests. You can customize the logic based on your application's requirements.
