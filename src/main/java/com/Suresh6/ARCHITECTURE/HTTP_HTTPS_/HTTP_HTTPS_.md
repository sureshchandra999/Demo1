what is HTTP and HTTPS?
========================
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used for transferring data over the web.
HTTP is the standard protocol used for transmitting data between a web server and a client (usually a web browser). It operates over port 80 and does not provide any encryption, meaning that data sent over HTTP can be intercepted and read by third parties.
HTTPS, on the other hand, is a secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data being transmitted between the server and the client. This encryption helps protect sensitive information, such as login credentials and payment details, from being intercepted by malicious actors. HTTPS operates over port 443.
The main differences between HTTP and HTTPS are:
1. Security: HTTPS provides encryption, while HTTP does not.
2. Port: HTTP uses port 80, while HTTPS uses port 443.
3. URL: URLs for HTTP start with "http://", while URLs for HTTPS start with "https://".
4. SEO: Search engines like Google give preference to HTTPS websites over HTTP ones, which can impact search rankings.
5. Trust: Users are more likely to trust websites that use HTTPS, as it indicates a higher level of security.
6. Certificate: HTTPS requires an SSL/TLS certificate to establish a secure connection, while HTTP does not.
7. Performance: HTTPS can be slightly slower than HTTP due to the overhead of encryption, but modern optimizations have minimized this difference.
8. Data integrity: HTTPS ensures that the data sent and received has not been tampered with during transmission, while HTTP does not provide this guarantee.
9. Browser indicators: Most web browsers display a padlock icon in the address bar for HTTPS sites, indicating a secure connection, while HTTP sites do not have this indicator.
10. Compatibility: Some features, such as HTTP/2 and QUIC, are only available over HTTPS.
In summary, HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP that provides encryption and data integrity, making it the preferred choice for transmitting sensitive information over the web.
HTTP and HTTPS are both essential for web communication, but HTTPS is the more secure option, especially for websites that handle sensitive data.

what are the error codes in HTTP?
===============================
HTTP error codes are standardized codes that indicate the status of a request made to a web server. They are grouped into five categories based on the first digit of the code:
1xx: Informational - These codes indicate that the request has been received and is being processed. They are rarely used in practice.
- 100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and the client should continue sending the rest.
- 101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.
- 102 Processing: The server is processing the request but no response is available yet.
- 103 Early Hints: The server is sending hints to the client about the resources that will be needed for the request.
- 104 Checkpoint: The server is indicating that the request has been received and is being processed, but no response is available yet.
- 105 Reset Content: The server is indicating that the request has been received and is being processed, but no response is available yet.
- 106 Partial Response: The server is indicating that the request has been partially fulfilled and the client should continue processing the rest of the request.
- 107 Multi-Status: The server is indicating that the request has been received and is being processed, but no response is available yet.
- 108 IM Used: The server is indicating that the request has been received and is being processed, but no response is available yet.
- 109 Processing: The server is processing the request but no response is available yet.
- 110 Early Hints: The server is sending hints to the client about the resources that will be needed for the request.
- 111 Upgrade Required: The server is indicating that the client should upgrade to a different protocol.
- 112 Retry With: The server is indicating that the client should retry the request with a different set of parameters.
- 113 Unavailable For Legal Reasons: The server is indicating that the request cannot be fulfilled for legal reasons.
- 114 Request Header Fields Too Large: The server is indicating that the request header fields are too large to process.
- 115 Request Entity Too Large: The server is indicating that the request entity is too large to process.

2xx: Success - These codes indicate that the request was successful and the server has returned the requested data. Common 2xx codes include:
- 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.
- 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource has been created.
- 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
- 205 Reset Content: The request was successful, and the client should reset the view.
- 206 Partial Content: The request was successful, and the server is returning only a portion of the requested resource.
- 207 Multi-Status: The request was successful, and the server is returning multiple status codes.
- 208 Already Reported: The request was successful, and the server is indicating that the resource has already been reported.
- 226 IM Used: The request was successful, and the server is indicating that the resource has been modified.
- 227 IM Used: The request was successful, and the server is indicating that the resource has been modified.
- 228 IM Used: The request was successful, and the server is indicating that the resource has been modified.

3xx: Redirection - These codes indicate that the requested resource has been moved or that further action is needed to complete the request. Common 3xx codes include:
- 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- 302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.
- 304 Not Modified: The requested resource has not been modified since the last request, and the cached version can be used.
- 305 Use Proxy: The requested resource must be accessed through a proxy.
- 306 Switch Proxy: The requested resource must be accessed through a different proxy.
- 307 Temporary Redirect: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL, and the client should use the new URL for future requests.
- 308 Permanent Redirect: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and the client should use the new URL for future requests.
- 309 Temporary Redirect: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL, and the client should use the new URL for future requests.
- 310 Permanent Redirect: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and the client should use the new URL for future requests.

4xx: Client Error - These codes indicate that there was an error with the request made by the client. Common 4xx codes include:
- 400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
- 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- 405 Method Not Allowed: The request method is not allowed for the requested resource.
- 406 Not Acceptable: The requested resource is not available in a format that the client can accept.
- 407 Proxy Authentication Required: The request requires authentication through a proxy.
- 408 Request Timeout: The server timed out waiting for the client to send the request.
- 409 Conflict: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
- 410 Gone: The requested resource is no longer available and has been permanently removed.
- 411 Length Required: The server requires a Content-Length header in the request.

5xx: Server Error - These codes indicate that there was an error on the server while processing the request. Common 5xx codes include:
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- 501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while processing the request.
