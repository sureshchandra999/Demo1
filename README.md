1. Singleton Design Pattern in Java:
====================================
Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only
one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful
when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Use Case of Singleton:

    Database Connection Management: Ensuring a single connection instance throughout the application.
    Logger Classes: Managing a single logger instance to centralize log information.


Use Case of Singleton Design Pattern: Database Connection Management

Problem Statement: In a software application, managing database connections efficiently is crucial for performance. Creating a new database connection for each request can be resource-intensive and impact system performance. We want to ensure that there is only one instance of a database connection manager throughout the application to handle connections effectively.

Solution: Singleton Design Pattern

Identifying the Need:

    Problem: Excessive creation of database connection instances.
    Solution: Implement a Singleton to manage a single instance of the database connection manager.
